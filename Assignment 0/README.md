QN 1. Why is data mining often used to describe the entire knowledge discovery process?

Even though data mining is technically only one step in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, many people—especially in industry, media, and research environments—use the term data mining to refer to the whole process. This happens for several reasons:

  a) Simplicity and Popularity

“Data mining” became a popular buzzword long before the detailed KDD framework was widely understood. Because the term is catchy and easy to use, people adopted it to describe all data-related activities.

  b) The Core Step of KDD

Data mining is the most visible and impactful step, where actual patterns, predictions, or insights are extracted using algorithms (e.g., classification, clustering). Because this step produces the final results, many assume it is the whole process.

  c) Industry Practice

In companies, people rarely talk about the preparation steps separately (cleaning, preprocessing, transformation). They simply call the whole workflow “data mining”, since it sounds more significant and aligns with product branding and marketing.

  d) Media and Education Influence

Media reports and introductory textbooks often focus on “data mining” when discussing analytics or big data, reinforcing the habit of using the term broadly.

  e) Ambiguous Boundaries

The steps before and after data mining (like preprocessing, interpretation, and evaluation) are closely connected. To non-experts, the entire workflow seems like one unified activity—so they use a single name for all of it.

QN 2. Differences between data wrangling, scanning, and filtering in data mining

a) Data Wrangling (or Data Cleaning)

This is the process of preparing raw data into a structured, usable form.

Includes:

I. Removing duplicates

II. Handling missing values

III. Correcting errors

IV. Changing data formats

V. Normalizing values



b) Scanning

Scanning means browsing through the data to understand it or detect potential patterns before applying algorithms.

Includes:

I. Exploring data distributions

II. Identifying obvious trends or anomalies

III. Reviewing samples of the dataset



c) Filtering

Filtering means selecting only relevant records or attributes from a dataset.

Includes:

I. Removing rows that do not meet certain conditions

II. Selecting specific columns/features

III. Excluding noise or irrelevant data
